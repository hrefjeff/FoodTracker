## Lesson 1: Building a basic UI
Familiarized with the contents of an Xcode project, and with many of the tools used to design and run an iOS app. Built a simple user interface

Made sure the layout is robust and extensible from the start ensures that you have a solid foundation to build upon.

## Lesson 2: Connect the UI to code

Used the assistant editor to add outlets (link ) and actions to your source code. Youâ€™ve also added code to update the user interface as the user interacts with the controls. The project is still just a relatively simple, single scene, but you will continue to add features and increase its complexity over the remaining lessons.

+ Explain the relationship between a scene in a storyboard and the underlying view controller
+ Create outlet and action connections between UI elements in a storyboard and source code
+ Process user input from a text field and display the result in the UI
+ Make a class conform to a protocol
+ Understand the delegation pattern
+ Follow the target-action pattern when designing app architecture

## Lesson 3: Working with View Controllers

+ Understand the view controller life cycle and its callbacks (for example, viewDidLoad, viewWillAppear and viewDidAppear) 
+ Pass data between view controllers
+ Dismiss a view controller
+ Use gesture recognizers to generate events
+ Anticipate object behavior based on the UIView/UIControl class hierarchy
+ Use the asset catalog to add image assets to a project

## Less 4: Implement a custom control

+ Create and associate custom source code files with elements in a storyboard
+ Define a custom class
+ Implement an initializer on a custom class
+ Use UIStackView as a container
+ Understand how to create views programmatically
+ Add accessibility information to a custom control
+ Work with @IBInspectable and @IBDesignable to display and control a custom view in Interface Builder
